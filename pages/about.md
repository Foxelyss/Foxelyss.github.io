# About me

I'm **programmer hobbyist**. I've programmed on different languages: Python, C, C++, C#, Rust,
Assembler, Lua, Java, and so on. And I **loved** all of them, because everyone has its own charm!
Different implementations of the same features, opinion on variable management, paradigms. Now what
I want is _show_ what I can do!

I'm also a gamer. Played many games and a lot, especially Minecraft and [SRB2]! But there are many games
which I'm interested playing.
